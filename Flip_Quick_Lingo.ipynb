                  "Collections are often so large that we cannot perform index construction efficiently on a single machine. This is particularly true of the World Wide Web for which we need large computer clusters [*]to construct any reasonably sized web index. Web search engines, therefore, use distributed indexing algorithms for index construction. The result of the construction process is a distributed index that is partitioned across several machines - either according to term or according to document. In this section, we describe distributed indexing for a\n",
                  "term-partitioned index . Most large search engines prefer a document-partitioned index (which can be easily generated from a term-partitioned index). We discuss this topic further in Section 20.3 (page [*]).\n",
                  "\n",
                  "The distributed index construction method we describe in this section is an application of MapReduce , a general architecture for distributed computing. MapReduce is designed for large computer clusters. The point of a cluster is to solve large computing problems on cheap commodity machines or nodes that are built from standard parts (processor, memory, disk) as opposed to on a supercomputer with specialized hardware. Although hundreds or thousands of machines are available in such clusters, individual machines can fail at any time. One requirement for robust distributed indexing is, therefore, that we divide the work up into chunks that we can easily assign and - in case of failure - reassign. A master node directs the process of assigning and reassigning tasks to individual worker nodes.\n",
                  "\n",
                  "The map and reduce phases of MapReduce split up the computing job into chunks that standard machines can process in a short time. The various steps of MapReduce are shown in Figure 4.5 and an example on a collection consisting of two documents is shown in Figure 4.6 . First, the input data, in our case a collection of web pages, are split into $n$ splits where the size of the split is chosen to ensure that the work can be distributed evenly (chunks should not be too large) and efficiently (the total number of chunks we need to manage should not be too large); 16 or 64 MB are good sizes in distributed indexing. Splits are not preassigned to machines, but are instead assigned by the master node on an ongoing basis: As a machine finishes processing one split, it is assigned the next one. If a machine dies or becomes a laggard due to hardware problems, the split it is working on is simply reassigned to another machine.\n",

                  "Thus far, we have assumed that the document collection is static. This is fine for collections that change infrequently or never (e.g., the Bible or Shakespeare). But most collections are modified frequently with documents being added, deleted, and updated. This means that new terms need to be added to the dictionary, and postings lists need to be updated for existing terms.\n",
                  "\n",
                  "The simplest way to achieve this is to periodically reconstruct the index from scratch. This is a good solution if the number of changes over time is small and a delay in making new documents searchable is acceptable - and if enough resources are available to construct a new index while the old one is still available for querying.\n",
                  "\n",
                  "If there is a requirement that new documents be included quickly, one solution is to maintain two indexes: a large main index and a small auxiliary index that stores new documents. The auxiliary index is kept in memory. Searches are run across both indexes and results merged. Deletions are stored in an invalidation bit vector. We can then filter out deleted documents before returning the search result. Documents are updated by deleting and reinserting them.\n",

                  "Each time the auxiliary index becomes too large, we merge it into the main index. The cost of this merging operation depends on how we store the index in the file system. If we store each postings list as a separate file, then the merge simply consists of extending each postings list of the main index by the corresponding postings list of the auxiliary index. In this scheme, the reason for keeping the auxiliary index is to reduce the number of disk seeks required over time. Updating each document separately requires up to $ M_{ave}$disk seeks, where $ M_{ave}$ is the average size of the vocabulary of documents in the collection. With an auxiliary index, we only put additional load on the disk when we merge auxiliary and main indexes.\n",

The simplest alternative is to store the index as one large file, that is, as a concatenation of all postings lists. In reality, we often choose a compromise between the two extremes (Section 4.7 ). To simplify the discussion, we choose the simple option of storing the index as one large file here.\n",

The Gini index is inherently suited to binary ratings, ordinal ratings, or ratings which are distributed into a small number of intervals. The latter case may sometimes be obtained by discretizing the ratings. The ordering among the ratings is ignored, and each possible value of the rating is treated as an instance of a categorical attribute value. This might seem like a disadvantage because it loses information about the relative ordering of the ratings. However, in practice, the number of possible ratings is usually small and therefore significant accuracy is not lost.\n",
                  "Entropy is very similar in principle to the Gini index except that information theoretic principles are used to design the measure. As in the previous case, let t be the total number of possible values of the rating and p1(w) . . . pt(w) be the fraction of the documents containing a particular word w, which are rated at each of these t possible values. \n",
                  "The value of Entropy(w) always lies in the range (0, 1), with smaller values being more indicative of discriminative power. It is easy to see that entropy has similar characteristics with the Gini index. In fact, these two measures often yield very similar results although they have different probabilistic interpretations. The Gini index is easier to understand, whereas entropy measures are more firmly grounded in mathematical principles from information theory.\n",
